# Hackathon-Oil-Price-Prediction
There was a hackathon organized to predict the prices of Oil based on time series analysis.

# Problem Statement
This is a forcasting problem for Oil Price Prediction based on past data. In oiling industry where external factors have huge impact on the cost, there is a need to have a prediction model which can predict the cost in future based on old data. We are building a predictive model to predict the future cost of oil based on training model with old data.

# Challenges in Hackathon
As we all were suddenly hit by the pandemic and observed situations no one ever thought of which impacted all class of people and business in all terms. Financial loss is the biggest threat we all have faced. To overcome such situations in future we should be ready with proper planning. 

This approach will help us predict future prices and we can save some money during less favorable situations.

# ML Workflow
The solution to this problem is achieved using below steps of Machine Learning:
 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
 2. Feature Engineering
 3. Random Forest Model
 4. Model Validation and Selection

# Key Acheivements:
The model was able to predict the future cost of oil based on pre-defined parameters.

# Technical Approach
1. Understanding dataâ€™s shape, attributes, missing data.
2. Univariate Analysis on dataset
3. Bivariate Analysis on dataset
4. Missing Value Imputation: KNN Imputer and MICE Imputation
5. Random Forest and XGBoost Model Training with different parameters
6. Model Validation

# Performance with Training Data
The details are present in the PPT File attached.

# Summary
The problem statement of predicting Cost of oil on basis of attributes is a very sensitive to incorrect predictions, hence we need to choose a model that has slightest error on training data and gives minimal error on validation data as well.
After trying various models with different parameters the model that performed best on data is:

The Mean Squared Error(MSE) is: 0.03091

In the process of working on this problem statement I was able to relate to many industry factors that are not very much visible to the outside world. Also the experience of working on this dataset was very realistic and helpful for someone who is new to Data Science.
